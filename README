xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

For this project, I added features like 
1) syscall tracing
2) Scheduling using the following policies 
    - FCFS ( First Come First Serve )
    - PBS  ( Priority Bases Scheduler )
    - MLFQ ( Multilevel Feedback queue scheduling )
3) procdump
